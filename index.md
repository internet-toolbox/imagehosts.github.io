# *Custom image host tier list*

~~~
Questions that might get asked-

Q : Why is there no score for upload speeds!?1!1?!
A : I live in Asia, and I have very bad wifi so I can't speak for the upload speeds of most image hosts.
    Basically, it depends heavily on your internet speed

## [EZ host](https://e-z.host) - A tier | 22/30

- EZ host is a popular image host in the image hosting community.

UI - 7/10

Extra tools - 6/10

- File uploader [25mb]
- URL shortner
- Pastebin

Support - ???

- Never had any issues with them, although asking the members of the discord server for support will cause severe brain damage

## [Horizon](https://horizon.pics) - A tier | 23/30

- A privacy respecting image host, with really good functionality.

UI - 7/10

- Looks pretty nice at first glance, but gets repetitive after some time, especially because of the color scheme

- URL shortner
  
- Pastebin
  
- Email service
  

Support - ???
