# *Custom image host tier list*

~~~
Questions that might get asked-

Q : Why is there no score for upload speeds!?1!1?!
A : I live in Asia, and I have very bad wifi so I can't speak for the upload speeds of most image hosts.
    Basically, it depends heavily on your internet speed

## [EZ host](https://e-z.host) - A tier | 22/30

- EZ host is a popular image host in the image hosting community.
  

UI - 7/10

- nothing special about the ui, works as intented and doesn't burn your eyes

Extra tools - 6/10

- File uploader [25mb]
- URL shortner
- Pastebin

Bio pages - 9/10

- Probably the best bio page I've seen so far, even better than 
  dedicated bio pages in some aspects
  
- Lets you add your social media, upload a video as background, and add
  music to the background!

Support - ???

- Never had any issues with them, although asking the members of the discord server for support will cause severe brain damage
  

## [Horizon](https://horizon.pics) - A tier | 23/30

- A privacy respecting image host, with really good functionality.
  

UI - 7/10

- Looks pretty nice at first glance, but gets repetitive after some time, especially because of the color scheme
  

Extra tools - 9/10

- File uploader [200mb upload limit]
  
- URL shortner
  
- Pastebin
  
- Email service
  

Bio pages - 7/10

- "Ok" bio pages, doesn't let you upload custom videos as background and doesn't let you upload

Support - ???

- Never had any problems with them, however the members seem very friendly and you can *probably* rely on the community for support.
