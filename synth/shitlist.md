---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: Upload speeds depend heavily on your internet speed, location and the amount of users uploading at the same time as you. My speeds may not be the same as yours.


//upload.systems (Formerly pays.host)

upload.systems (formerly known as pays.host) is one of the most known image hosts, it provides outstanding uptime and reliability due to its strong DDoS protection.

It also comes with multiple servers depending on your location, making your upload times a bit faster, keep in mind that due to them hosting over 950GB worth of files and due to the thousands of users constantly uploading, upload speeds wont be super fast like some other lesser used/known hosts.

After its rewrite it has added countless of features and more customization than ever before, some may call their subscriptions a downside but it is not a issue, as every core feature there was beforehand is not paid at all and will be free forever.

Their UI looks very nice and is pretty easy to navigate, which considering for how long upload.systems was a thing, isnt a surprise.
For people that are new to image hosts, they even have a tutorial on how to set up and use upload.systems

As of right now, you do not need any invite to register an account on upload.systems, and it appears it will stay like that forever.

Support: Fast, good and straight to the point. 10/10
UI: "Very Nice" -Borat 10/10
Speed: Decently Fast. 7.5/10






//celeste.photos

Celeste is a lesser known hosting service made by Front, it has a very nice looking UI and decent upload speeds.

You can currently download one of their various apps to use the host (Yup, thats right apps). They currently support Windows & Linux, however it does appear (judging by the landing page) that there will be support for MacOS, iOS & Android.

Their UI is very nicely made and is (after the rewrite) no longer cluttered and basic. They provide a decent amount of features, but as you probably predicted, are missing some, however this doesn't affect the service at all and can still be used normally.

Support: Based on previous review: Helpful, good, slow 8/10
UI: "Very Nice" -Borat 10/10
Speed: Decently Fast 7/10






// tesla.sexy
tesla.sexy is a privacy respecting host which has released a long time ago. The landing page is pretty basic and minimal and has a nice gradient and the logo in the middle. Their dark mode button is not working and hasn't been working for months now.

The login page has a ton of similarities between confighub.host and theirs, however I do not know if this was copied from a tutorial or not.

Their dashboard is really not good compared to other hosts, it is missing dark mode and is missing key features (customization-wise)

tesla.sexy has not been updated for months now either, so it really isnt the best solution for image hosting, you should instead go with something like upload.systems or horizon.pics


Support: Helpful, fast, good. 10/10
UI: Not particulary good, a bit too bright too. 4/10
Speed: Really fast. 9/10






//e-z.host
e-z.host is a relatively known host, it is a FORK of astral (yes there is a difference), it has a pretty nice UI and is pretty private. As of right now you have to get voted in to be accepted to the host or you can buy an invite for 2.5$.

It is modified astral so nearly all of the features are relatively known to most people, they currently support Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android. (mans got the infinty stones)

They have a ton of domains with my personal favorite being "my-balls-it.ch", because well, my balls itch. They support the following features: Long URL, Invisible Filename, Fake URL, Custom Filepath, Emoji URL, Amogus (sus) Filename, Show Link, Discord Embeds & Random Domain

If you wish to, you can set up auto file wiping or custom webhook logging (Sends the picture link to your webhook that you set it to, making your embeds significantly faster)

They even have a bios page (obviously this wasnt in original astral) which is really neat & cool, in the bios page you can set your socials, background video, music & etc.

The speeds are really fast for me (~350ms), making it a viable choice customization-wise AND speed-wise, overall really impressive & great for an astral fork.


Support: I don't think I ever needed it ?/10
UI: Pretty nice. 8.5/10
Speed: Really fast. 10/10






// fakecri.me
fakecri.me is a relitavely unknown host, however it does appear their main focus is being a "profile picture library". They have really overused the glow efefct and the dark water background, making the UI look a bit trash.

They seem to have recently updated the UI a bit, however their forum and giveaways page is STILL under maintenance.

They have embed and invisible URL options in the upload settings, but you cannot activate them. The only thing you can do is set your domain and download the config file, meaning it is missing a ton of core features and some optional features.

However their upload speeds are extremely fast from the looks of it (~450ms as of right now).


Support: Didn’t need support. ?/10
UI: Overused particles, glow effect and their water background. Overall sucks ass. 0/10
Speed: Really fast. 10/10






// kurwa.club

kurwa.club is a decently popular image host and webmail provider. It has a pretty nicely made UI and has many features. It has a pretty slow uploading speeds taking up to 2 seconds (as of right now that is).

Some features are locked behind a premium plan which is a one-time payment of $15 USD via PayPal in order to access things like their webmail, custom UID and increased upload limit. However core features are not locked behind a paywall at all and is still usable.

The UI is pretty 'simplistic' and has great staff, however they do have only one URL (kurwa.club), but it does support fake URL. However, fake URL can be patched at any moment meaning it is not really reliable if you want to have "funny" URLs.


Support: Did not need support ?/10
UI: "veri epok" -Some Random Fortnite Player 10/10
Speed: "snail speed" -me. 3/10






\\ !! if theres something wrong with the below reviews, blame klook & nahsahh :trolla: !! //

// elixi.re - Does not appear to need an update and I don’t have access to this host.

elixi.re is not too well known but it has been around for a while. Mostly used and popularized in online XMPP chat servers, it is known as an image host to supplement those chat rooms. Due to this being the case, there aren't really any good upload settings for Discord. There isn’t fake url, invis url, or even an option to embed. Their domain selection is okay for the most part.

This host is open source and has been pasted by many other hosts so be careful of that. Their source code can be found on their GitLab.

Their UI is pretty easy to use except there are some rough edges that should be fleshed out cause some of the features on their website don’t look the best.

Summary:
Okay simple host but not optimized for Discord or anything else that isn’t XMPP really. It can be used for Discord and has some okay domains.

Support: 1/10 - Won’t add me back and I can’t get into their Discord server because it is locked behind a bot that will instantly kick you.
UI: 5/10 - Some things could be fixed.
Speed: 6/10 - Not the fastest...






//Horizon.pics - nahsahh made this so go thank him xddxdxd

horizon.pics is quite an unknown image hosting service which has been inspired to expand more than just an image host. It has so far withheld a strong and long uptime which is proven considering it rarely ever goes down during updates/bug fixes, they have out of this world have increased privacy measures unseen in the image host community until now just to make sure you and your data is safe, which makes sure you can always rely on such images of yours not getting leaked, However their ui could be done with improving, but their features are endless, over 100mb upload per file full embed customisation and more, consisting with new features all of the time, like mail/bios bundled with their multiple discord bots.
 
Support: N/A
UI: Easy to navigate but could be improved in the looks of it 5/10
Embed Speed: Fast upload speeds in various locations from what i have seen and not many slow uploads 9/10

\ !! if theres something wrong with the above reviews, blame klook & nahsahh :trolla: !! //






//Dapper (thighs.host)
Dapper is a decently known image hosting servic that (supposedly) respects your privacy. It currently has a decent amount of domains that even include y0u.tube if you wanna scam some chinese 7 year old over the internet.

You do not need a invite code - however you do need an API key which is obtainable by simply DMing the owner.

It has a ton of core features & optional features, making it a nice choice if you want customization. I cannot test speeds as of right now as my config doesn't appear to be working, however my previous speeds were ~300ms.


Support: Only one staff member who will probably not be able to help a ton. 3/10
UI: "dog water" -Fortnite Player. 2/10
Speed: Really fast. 10/10 (BASED ON PREVIOUS REVIEW)








//tixte.com

Tixte is a pretty known image host - mostly for the fact they gave away a TON of invites to people. As of right now the service is open to the public and you can register at any given moment.

Their dashboard/UI is pretty nice and non-cluttered, they have a decent amount of domains but it appears you can only register one subdomain per domain (pretty confusing for newcomers). It also appears they only allow 3 subdomains per domain for free users, you will have to pay for a subscription in order to use more subdomains. As far as I know, you cannot have the same subdomain as an another user has.

Currently Tixte has custom CSS support, essentially if someone had custom CSS and you went to their upload link directly, you would see that background they have set.

They no longer let you set a custom upload region from what I can tell, however I believe their servers are in the US as that was not so long ago, the only region you can select. However, their speeds are still relatively fast, clocking at ~600ms.

If you ever face issues with the service, you can simply upload debug logs which Tixte support can see, making their support 10x better, however this isnt good for privacy enthusiasts (atleast from what I can tell, I have 0 idea what they log).

You can currently even log out of every session there is, incase you ever feel that your account has been breached and that you need to change your password immediately

They are missing a decent bit of optional features, however they are in beta so this is understandable. All the core features are there meaning it is still usable.


Support: Never required support. ?/10
UI: Pretty nice. 9/10
Speed: Decent. 7.5/10






//imgs.today (formerly known as cheems.dog)

imgs.today (formerly known as cheems.dog) is a pretty unknown image host, currently it has a decent frontend, they do use green alot which (in my opinion and my opinion only.) is pretty meh for a pallete.

You can currently login only using Discord, but their host is iirc in beta testing stages so its understandable.

They (as of right now) have 7 domains, 2 of which are free domains. They are missing a ton of core features and optional features, but again its in beta. However, their speeds are really fast (~300ms), their servers are as of right now located in Warsaw.

I will go more in depth when the full release comes.


Support: Never required support - ??/10
UI: (IN MY OPINION) Meh color choice, could use buttons instead of link labels. 4/10
Speed: NNNNNNNNYOOOOOOOOOOOOOM (codeword for really fast). 10/10
6vz: Cool. 10/10






//gato.host

gato.host is a relatively known image hosting service (known due to the drama they had). It has a really meh frontend with waves at bottom that block the MOTD and user/upload count by a significant bit depending on your resolution.

They don't have much and the "V2" is nearly the same as the V1, just uglier colors and new landing page.

They have been involved in some drama, however this drama has been resolved ages ago.


Support: Never required support - ?/10
UI: Ugly colors, really basic, barely different from V1 (This is apparently V2) - 2/10
Speed: Pretty fast - 9/10





//gamings.host

gamings.host is a relatively unknown service, it only has 43 users and 22 domains.

The frontend has a modern minimalistic and material Google-like look, it is rather very nice looking considering this used to be a astral paste.

Upon logging in you are greeted by the dashboard (obviously), it shows the currently set MOTD, your amount of invites, total images, your key and even has your gallery, you can also upload on the website using the web uploader, the dashboard was nicely designed along with the rest of the website.

In settings you can change stuff such as your timezone, subdomain/domain, domain path and other URL settings, including embed settings. As a security feature they offer 'IP Locking' which they say is to prevent session replay attacks. You can also turn on 2FA if you don't want your account getting compromised, as of right now viewing your data is broken however I believe that will be fixed in the future.


Support: Never required support - ?/10
UI: Very nice - 8.5/10 
Speed: ?/10 - Cannot be reviewed at the moment. This will be updated in a bit.





//hyper.pics

worst host serveie ce ever!!1 0/10
There should be a new UI coming soon so I will be holding off reviewing this until that drops.


Support: 0/10!!!!!
UI:  0/10!!!!!
Speed: 0/10!!!!!





//shibe.host

shibe.host is a pretty unknown and private image host, the frontend is pretty simple and I kind of like the simplicity, however the frontend can be better.

It does miss a ton of features compared to other hosts however it can still be used as a proper image host.

I don't really have anything more than that to work with so this is where the review ends.


Support: Never required support - ?/10
UI: Simple. but can be improved - 5.5/10
Speed: ?/10 - Cannot be reviewed at the moment. This will be updated in a bit.





//tiny.rip

tiny.rip is a really unknown image hosting service, the frontend is uhh, really not that good per se. Everything is ""inspired"" by Discords' client(s) and is really just.. weird. It isnt really well made either.

It misses a humongous amount of features, including embed customization out of all the things. I seriously don't know whether or not the owner is a anti-semetic/homophobic too considering that for a /filepath option they have a 'Swastika' preset, including a 'Anti-Gay' one. 

I have quite literally nothing more to work with other than that.


Support: Never required support - ?/10
UI:  Really bad, Discord copycat.. - 2/10
Speed: ?/10 - Cannot be reviewed at the moment. This will be updated in a bit.





//nest.rip

[Review will go here]
[Currently in beta, will be reviewed upon full official release]


Support: ?/10
UI:  ?/10
Speed: ?/10 - Cannot be reviewed at the moment. This will be updated in a bit.





//unkn0wn.cloud

unkn0wn.cloud is a very unkown image hosting service, it appears to be used mostly by people related to activities such as DDoSing and cracking, so I don't know how much you can exactly trust the service. However it does have many good domains.

The frontend is pretty simple, however at times it knows to be broken, for example, when you press some of the buttons within the dashboard, it will for some reason try to refresh or something ~15 times and only then take you to it.

The dashboard greets you with 4 buttons: Upload new file, shorten a URL, generate ShareX config and edit your settings. Due to this being a image host review I wont be reviewing the shortening part, obviously.

For now the only settings you can change is your embed settings and setting a fake URL.

That is the only stuff I've got to work with so I cannot review this any further.


Support: Never required support - ?/10
UI: Decently nice.. Kinda mid though - 5.5/10
Speed: ?/10 - Cannot be reviewed at the moment. This will be updated in a bit.

//keshsenpai.com - Being rewritten in C++
//exity.network - Still under development as of May 24, 2022
//ventry.host - SHUTDOWN - Due to the recent majorly known breach, the host has shut down. A anon group has breached ventry.host and multiple accounts AtomicHxH has.
// image.surf - SHUTDOWN - You probably already know this but due to the merge of vortex.sh (new tesla.sexy) and image.surf, the host has shut down. Vortex.sh has yet to release.
// benny.pink - SHUTDOWN - The previous reason wasnt correct, however I do believe their entire VPS was wiped, really unsure.
// catgirls.wtf [BETA] - SHUTDOWN - Has been dead for ages now, do not know the reason.
// astral.cool - SHUTDOWN - Owner decided to shut down astral (long ago), I forgot the reason so ask him yourself, I presume he didn't have enough time to work on it or it was a pain in the ass considering he rewrote it multiple times.
// voltic.dev - SHUTDOWN - Reason unknown
//skootiny.club - SHUTDOWN/REBRANDED -  I no longer have access to the Discord server as I was banned, don't know why, therefore I cannot comment on this

You may have asked yourself, what's happend with IHC? Did you get token logged? Short answer, no.
I am not dumb to fall for a token logger, nor will I ever. As I always say to newbs. Do not run random exes, trust no one, not even your closest friend. Always use any.run and sandboxie on random exes.

The raid had nothing to do with radiant.cool in any way shape or form, I may come back to update the list, but that will probably be never.
I understand that some people are mad, but the server was dead anyways, 9 messages per year. And it was honestly filled to the brim with autism.
It was a fun concept, but the execution was very poor, which made it even worse, and we were overkill with enforcing the rules, making it auschwitz 2.0
I will probably be leaving the community, but will be in certain servers still. If you have any questions, DM me, if I do not wish to answer the question, I'll probably ignore you.
-synth

tl;dr: Trust no one, not even your closest friend. You do not truly know them, nor their intentions
