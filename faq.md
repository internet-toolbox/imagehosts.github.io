Questions that might get asked-

Q : Why is there no score for upload speeds!?1!1?! <br>
A : I live in Asia, and I have very bad wifi so I can't speak for 
    the upload speeds of most image hosts.
    Basically, it depends heavily on your internet speed

Q : Why is this written in markdown instead of html or anything that isn't markdown?<br>
A : Few reasons actually,
    - I don't want to
    - Markdown is easily formattable, editable and loads much faster
    
Q : Why isn't this hosted on a custom domain?<br>
A : Because I don't want to buy a custom domain and vps just so I can host a markdown website :skull:

Q : Inspiration?<br>
A : Wouldn't call [this](https://bin.fbi.pics/list/ehQPt) inspiration for starting the project, but I did take inspiration for the ranking system etc. 

Q : How are extra tools ranked? Some services have more extra tools but a lower score compared to ones with less extra tools <br>
A : It's ranked by how well each of the tools perform, for example, if a service has a pastebin and and an uploader with really low upload limit, it's ranked lower           because of that. the ranking system is imperfect as of now and will be moved to a different page, or be integrated with the bios page and renamed to extra tools
